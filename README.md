# GameRoom
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client The Game Room wanted to create a game that would be mobile. Creative Technology Solutions stepped in to take on the job and create the onling mobile
  version of the game. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I recorded all changes and kept the customer in the loop about the daily changes and gain in the programming. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The test cases allowed me to rethink the coding and finish the project.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I could better rewrite the comments, i wrote plain jane comments that are to the point.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I had to do massive research, because java is not a storng suite langauge for me. The user is the end reciever, and if the program does not fit their needs then                        it is garbage.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I wrote what i thought could work, then tested it. I changes an rewrote it again until it worked as the software needs. I would ask for more information to                complete the project.
